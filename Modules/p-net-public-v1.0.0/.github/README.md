# Evaluation version

This repository contains an evaluation version of **P-Net**, a P-Net stack
for Profinet Device implementations. It is especially well suited for
embedded systems where resources are limited and efficiency is crucial.
It is written in C and can be run on an RTOS such as rt-kernel, FreeRTOS,
or on Linux.

It does not contain any ports and cannot be built without adding additional sources.

See [readme](../README.md) for more information on the complete version of the stack and the [releases](https://github.com/rtlabs-com/p-net/releases)  for binary downloads for common targets.

This version of P-Net can be used for evaluation purposes
only. Contact <sales@rt-labs.com> if you intend to use this stack in a
product or if you need assistance during evaluation. The commercial
version of this stack is supplied with full sources.
